  [COLOR red]---------------------------------- Thanks for choosing [B]MK-IV[/B]! ----------------------------------[/COLOR]

     If you have any questions or issues please use the contact form link located inside the MK-IV Wizard.
  
     As of December 2016 I have started migrating everything to a new permanent server. Along with this I will probably be shutting
  down the MK-IV website. 
  
     The only difference you may notice is the direct MK-IV Repository link will change from [COLOR cornflowerblue]http://get.mkiv.ca[/COLOR] to
  [COLOR cornflowerblue]https://MK-IV.github.io/[/COLOR] (get.mkiv.ca is forwarding to this link now). Ares users will not be affected and the change has already 
  been made. 

    
                                                                                                   [B][COLOR lime]Merry Christmas Everyone![/COLOR][COLOR red] :)[/COLOR][/B]
